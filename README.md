# Tv-Show
An application that lets users add their favorite tv shows to a list. That list is linked to a sql server database where all its information is stored.
To design this application I used Visual Studio ASP.Net Core(MVC). I then created a model, a controller, and added the views necessary to make the application function. 
The main language used was C#. Others include TSQL, HTML, and Javascript.
