# Tv-Show
An application that lets users add their favorite tv shows to a list. That list is linked to a sql server database where all its information is stored.
To design this application I used Visual Studio ASP.Net Core(MVC). I then created a model, a controller, and added the views necessary to make the application function. Users can add, delete, and edit their favorite shows names, descriptions, and the year they were released.
The languages used were C#, TSQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
